Try to have as good a life as you can under the circumstances.
Slow day.  Practice crawling.
When I reflect upon the number of disagreeable people who I know who have gone
to a better world, I am moved to lead a different life.
		-- Mark Twain, "Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar"
Excellent time to become a missing person.
